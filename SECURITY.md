## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Cookii Rails app, please do not hesitate to report it to us. You can report a vulnerability by emailing us at security@cookiiapp.com.

We take all reports seriously and will investigate any potential vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. Once we receive a report, we will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide an estimated timeline for when we will provide an update on the issue.

If the reported vulnerability is accepted, we will work to address the issue as soon as possible and release a patch or new version of the app as soon as it's ready. If the vulnerability is declined, we will explain our reasoning and provide suggestions for alternative approaches to mitigating the issue.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to investigate and release a fix, as this could put other users of the app at risk.

Thank you for helping us keep Cookii Rails app secure.
