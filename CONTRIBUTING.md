Before starting work on a new feature or fixing a bug, create a new branch off the latest main branch.

Write clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes you've made.

Make sure to write tests for any new functionality or changes you've made to existing code.

Follow the existing code style and formatting guidelines in the project. If none exist, consider adopting a popular style guide like Rubocop.

Keep your pull requests small and focused on a single feature or bug fix. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand and provide feedback.

Be open to feedback and be willing to make changes to your code based on the suggestions of others.

Be respectful and professional in all communications with other contributors, maintainers, and users of the project.

If you're not sure about something, don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification from the maintainers or other contributors.

If you encounter a bug or have an idea for a new feature, create an issue on the project's issue tracker before starting work on it.

Before merging your changes, make sure they have been reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor.

These guidelines should help ensure that contributions to your Cookii Rails app are of high quality, easy to review, and improve the overall quality of the project.
